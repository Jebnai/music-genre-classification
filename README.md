## Overview

This project's objective is to develop and assess machine learning models for categorizing musical genres using audio features taken from the GTZAN dataset. The following significant elements are part of it:

- Preprocessing of the data: examining, loading, and preprocessing the GTZAN dataset.
- Feature Extraction: Taking relevant audio cues from music tracks and extracting them.
- Model Building: Development and training of machine learning classification models.
- Model Evaluation: Measuring model effectiveness with a range of metrics.
- Deep Learning: Investigating methods for identifying musical genres using deep learning.
- Visualization: Putting model output and insights into a visual format.

## Dataset

The GTZAN dataset, which can be found at [GTZAN Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification), is used in this project. It has 1,000 audio tracks, each lasting 30 seconds, divided into 10 different musical genres:

1. Blues
2. Classical
3. Country
4. Disco
5. Hiphop
6. Jazz
7. Metal
8. Pop
9. Reggae
10. Rock

Download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the 'Data' directory before running.
